# UI5 Application sap.ui.core.samples.unittable

This application shows you how to use dynamic format options in a table for each cell using a separate type.

In the example, we assume that a power generator wants to display electricity meters in a table for which each current
meter has a different number of decimal places.

## Run the App

Execute the following command to run the app.

```sh
npm start
```

As shown in the terminal after executing this command, the app is then running on
http://localhost:8000/test-resources/sap/ui/core/samples/databinding/UnitTable/webapp/index.html. Note that the port may
vary.
